## Text corpus
A bunch of text to define our fitness function!

### Corpus of English language text

### Corpus of code
Selected several medium-large projects with mixed languages.

## Goal: evolve the most fit keyboard
You can edit everything except for:
* Representation
* Basic print function
* The fitness function and it's supporting data structures
* Main driver

You must write the rest!
You can use the function headers provided,
but you do not have to.
The only constraint is that you use a custom EC,
that you write yourself.
